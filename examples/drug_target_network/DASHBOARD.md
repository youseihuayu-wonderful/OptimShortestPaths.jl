# Drug-Target Network Analysis Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This dashboard presents comprehensive results from applying the DMY shortest-path algorithm to drug-target networks, including both **single-objective** optimization and **multi-objective Pareto front** analysis.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Single-objective**: Celecoxib remains the most COX-2 selective option (~3.7× vs COX-1) while all sample drugs reach every target
2. **Multi-objective**: Seven Pareto-optimal drug pathways span efficacy 40–98%, toxicity 3–70%, cost \$5–\$200, and onset 1.0–7.5 h
3. **Performance**: DMY achieves ≈4.8× speedup over Dijkstra at n=5000 for sparse graphs (k = ⌈n^{1/3}⌉)

### Reproducibility

All scripts accept a deterministic seed via either `OPTIM_SP_SEED` or a `--seed=` flag. Example:

```bash
OPTIM_SP_SEED=2024 julia --project=. drug_target_network.jl
```

If no seed is provided, the default (`42`) is used. Use the same flag when generating figures to ensure the plots and tables align with the narrative below.

## Part 1: Single-Objective Analysis

### Figure 1: Drug-Target Binding Affinity Matrix
![Binding Affinity Heatmap](figures/binding_affinity_heatmap.png)

**Interpretation**: 
- Matrix shows normalized binding affinities (0=no binding, 1=perfect binding)
- Celecoxib: Strong COX-2 (0.95), weak COX-1 (0.05) → Selective inhibitor
- Aspirin: Strong COX-1 (0.85), moderate COX-2 (0.45) → Non-selective

### Figure 2: COX-2/COX-1 Selectivity Profile

**Clinical Significance**:

| Drug | Selectivity | Interpretation | GI Risk |
|------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Celecoxib | 3.7× | Strong COX-2 preference | Low |
| Ibuprofen | 2.0× | Mild COX-2 preference | Low-Moderate |
| Acetaminophen | 1.2× | Slight COX-2 tilt | Low |
| Aspirin | 0.7× | COX-1 biased (non-selective) | Higher |

## Part 2: Multi-Objective Pareto Front Analysis

### The Challenge
Real-world drug selection involves multiple competing objectives:
- **Efficacy**: How well does it work?
- **Toxicity**: What are the side effects?
- **Cost**: Can patients afford it?
- **Time**: How quickly does it act?

### Figure 3: 2D Pareto Front Projections
![Pareto Front 2D](figures/drug_pareto_front.png)

**Four critical trade-offs visualized**:
1. **Efficacy vs Toxicity**: Higher efficacy drugs have more side effects
2. **Efficacy vs Cost**: Better drugs cost more
3. **Toxicity vs Cost**: Safer drugs are expensive
4. **Time vs Efficacy**: Fast-acting drugs may be less effective

### Figure 4: 3D Pareto Front Visualization
![Pareto Front 3D](figures/drug_pareto_3d.png)

**3D Trade-off Space**: This plot shows the three most critical objectives simultaneously:
- **X-axis (Efficacy)**: Treatment effectiveness (0–100 %)
- **Y-axis (Toxicity)**: Side effect severity (0–100 %)
- **Z-axis (Cost)**: Price in dollars (\$5–\$200 across the frontier)

Legend highlights:
- **Red sphere — “Max Efficacy”**: Morphine-like → MOR (Solution 5) delivers ~98 % efficacy in 1 h at the cost of high toxicity (70 %) and \$50.
- **Green sphere — “Min Toxicity”**: Ibuprofen-like → COX-2 (Solution 3) keeps toxicity at 10 % with moderate efficacy (~60 %) and \$15 cost.
- **Orange sphere — “Min Cost”**: Aspirin-like → COX-1 (Solution 1) is the \$5 budget choice with 85 % efficacy and 30 % toxicity.
- **Purple hexagon — “Knee Point”**: Morphine-like → COX-1 (Solution 4) marks the steepest trade-off change (95 % efficacy, 60 % toxicity, \$50).

The remaining Pareto solutions (grey) illustrate the continuous trade-offs between these extremes.

### Representative Pareto-Optimal Solutions

| Solution | Drug→Target | Efficacy | Toxicity | Cost | Time | **When to Use** |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Aspirin-like → COX-1 | 85% | 30% | \$5 | 2.5 h | **Baseline analgesia** – inexpensive, moderate toxicity |
| 2 | Ibuprofen-like → COX-1 | 65% | 15% | \$15 | 3.5 h | **General pain** – balanced efficacy/toxicity |
| 3 | Ibuprofen-like → COX-2 | 60% | 10% | \$15 | 4.0 h | **Elderly / GI risk** – prioritize low toxicity |
| 4 | Morphine-like → COX-1 | 95% | 60% | \$50 | 1.5 h | **Severe pain** – high efficacy, monitor side effects |
| 5 | Morphine-like → MOR | 98% | 70% | \$50 | 1.0 h | **Emergency trauma** – fastest, most potent relief |
| 6 | Biologic-like → COX-2 | 45% | 5% | \$200 | 6.5 h | **High-risk patients** – ultra-low toxicity despite high cost |
| 7 | Biologic-like → MOR | 40% | 3% | \$200 | 7.5 h | **Neuropathic pain** – minimal adverse effects, accepts slow onset |

High-cost biologic options (Solutions 6–7) reduce toxicity to ≤5% while maintaining moderate efficacy (40–45%), but require \$200 outlay and a 6.5–7.5 h onset.

### How to Select from Pareto Front

#### Method 1: Weighted Sum Approach
Because this problem mixes maximize (efficacy) and minimize (toxicity/cost/time) objectives, a direct weighted sum requires transforming the maximize objectives into costs (e.g., use `1 - efficacy`). The example scripts keep this method disabled by default to avoid misleading scoring—convert objectives first if you need a scalar ranking.

#### Method 2: Constraint-Based Selection
Set hard limits on certain objectives:
- Toxicity ≤ 30% → Aspirin-like → COX-1 (Solution 1) is the lone candidate
- Cost ≤ \$20 → Aspirin-like (Solution 1), Ibuprofen-like COX-1/COX-2 (Solutions 2–3)
- Both constraints → Ibuprofen-like COX-1/COX-2 trade a little efficacy for safety

#### Method 3: Knee Point Selection
The current knee point is the Morphine-like → MOR pathway (Solution 5):
- Maximum efficacy (≈98%) with 1 h onset
- Accept high toxicity (70%) and higher cost (\$50)
- Suitable when rapid, potent analgesia outweighs side-effect risk

- Crossover around n ≈ 2,000 vertices for sparse graphs
- Large sparse graphs (n ≥ 2,000): DMY delivers ≈1.8×–4.8× speedups
- Results match the canonical `benchmark_results.txt` file

## Key Takeaways

### Single vs Multi-Objective
- **Single-objective**: One "best" path (e.g., Celecoxib for COX-2 selectivity)
- **Multi-objective**: Seven non-dominated solutions on the Pareto front
- **Real-world**: Multi-objective reflects clinical reality better

### Algorithm Performance
- **Small graphs (n < 1,000)**: Dijkstra is faster (DMY at 0.3×–0.4× speed)
- **Large sparse graphs (n ≥ 2,000)**: DMY delivers ≈1.8×–4.8× speedups
- **Sparse networks**: DMY's sweet spot (k = ⌈n^{1/3}⌉)

### Clinical Impact
- **No universal "best" drug**: Context determines optimal choice
- **Trade-offs are explicit**: Pareto front visualizes all options
- **Personalized medicine enabled**: Match solution to patient
