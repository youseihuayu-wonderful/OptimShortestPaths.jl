# OptimShortestPaths Framework Comprehensive Dashboard

## Optimization Problems Unified as Shortest-paths

*A framework for transforming optimization problems into graph shortest-path problems*

---

**Reproducibility**: All scripts accept `--seed=<int>` (or `OPTIM_SP_SEED=<int>`) to replay exact synthetic datasets and benchmarks. Default seed is `42`.

---

## Executive Summary

The DMY algorithm achieves O(m log^(2/3) n) complexity for directed single-source shortest paths with non-negative weights. On sparse graphs (m ≈ 2n):

- Break-even near 2,000 vertices: 1.77× faster than Dijkstra
- At 5,000 vertices: 4.79× faster than Dijkstra
- Sub-millisecond performance on practical problems

## Framework Overview

OptimShortestPaths transforms optimization problems into shortest-path problems on directed graphs.

**Transformation Flow:**

```
Optimization Problem → Graph Representation → Shortest Path → Optimal Solution
      (Transform)          (DMY Algorithm)        (Interpret)
```

### Transformation Method

| Original Problem | Graph Representation | Solution Meaning |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| States/Configurations | Vertices | Points in solution space |
| Allowed Transitions | Edges | Valid moves or decisions |
| Transition Costs | Edge Weights | Cost of decisions |
| Constraints | Missing Edges | Invalid transitions |
| Multi-objective | Vector Weights | Pareto optimization |
| Optimal Solution | Shortest Path | Best decision sequence |

### Six-Step Process

1. **IDENTIFY STATES** - Define problem configurations as vertices
2. **DEFINE TRANSITIONS** - Map valid moves as edges
3. **QUANTIFY COSTS** - Assign weights to transitions
4. **SPECIFY OBJECTIVES** - Determine optimization goals
5. **HANDLE CONSTRAINTS** - Remove invalid edges
6. **SOLVE & INTERPRET** - Find shortest path as solution

*Results generated via `dev/benchmark_performance.jl` using 40 warm trials on sparse random graphs (m ≈ 2n)*

### Key Observations

- Theoretical complexity: O(m log^(2/3) n) for sparse graphs
- Performance advantage increases with graph size
- Most effective on sparse graphs (density < 10%)
- Break-even point around 2,000 vertices

### Domain Coverage

- **Supply Chain & Logistics** - Route optimization, inventory management
- **Healthcare** - Treatment pathways, resource allocation
- **Finance** - Portfolio optimization, risk management
- **Transportation** - Route planning, traffic optimization
- **Manufacturing** - Process optimization, scheduling

## Multi-Objective Optimization

OptimShortestPaths handles competing objectives through Pareto optimization. The seeded synthetic portfolio (150 strategies) yields 29 non-dominated solutions spanning:

- **Cost**: 50–93 k$
- **Time**: 20–62 days
- **Quality**: 0.54–1.00

### Pareto Summary (seed = 42)

| ID | Cost (k$) | Time (days) | Quality | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | 50.0 | 51.4 | 0.54 | Lowest cost, slower delivery |
| 7 | 63.8 | 30.5 | 0.86 | Balanced cost/time |
| 12 | 67.5 | 46.9 | 0.97 | Highest quality mid-cost |
| 18 | 78.2 | 28.6 | 0.91 | Fast with strong quality |
| 24 | 82.7 | 24.7 | 0.95 | Near-optimal across metrics |
| 29 | 92.9 | 20.0 | 1.00 | Premium option, max quality |

## Supply Chain Case Study

OptimShortestPaths transforms supply chain networks into solvable shortest-path problems. For comprehensive implementation, see [Supply Chain Example](../supply_chain/).
