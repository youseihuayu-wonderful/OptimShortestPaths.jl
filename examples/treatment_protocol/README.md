# Treatment Protocol Optimization

## 🌟 Intuitive Introduction: The Journey Through Healthcare as a Path Problem

Imagine a patient's journey through the healthcare system as a traveler navigating a complex city. Each intersection represents a clinical decision point—surgery or chemotherapy? aggressive or conservative treatment?—and each road has its own cost in terms of money, time, risk, and potential benefit. The challenge is to find the optimal route from diagnosis to desired outcome.

From a physicist's perspective, this is strikingly similar to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, where particles "explore" all possible paths between two points, with each path weighted by its action. Here, patients traverse treatment pathways, with each path weighted by its cost-effectiveness ratio. The principle of stationary action in physics becomes the principle of optimal treatment in medicine.

There's a deep analogy to thermodynamics here: just as systems evolve toward states of minimum free energy, healthcare systems naturally evolve toward protocols that minimize the "treatment energy"—a combination of financial cost, patient burden, and risk. The DMY algorithm helps us find these minimum-energy pathways through the treatment landscape.

What makes this particularly elegant is how we encode clinical wisdom into graph structure: edges represent feasible treatment transitions (you can't have surgery before diagnosis), weights encode multi-dimensional costs, and the shortest path represents the optimal clinical pathway. It's constraint optimization made tangible.

## 🔄 Two Approaches: Generic vs Domain-Specific

This example demonstrates **BOTH** approaches for using OptimShortestPaths:

### **Approach 1: Generic Functions (Direct Graph Manipulation)**
The example shows how to use domain-agnostic functions:
- `find_shortest_path(graph, source, target)` - Find optimal treatment sequence
- `analyze_connectivity(graph, vertex)` - Analyze treatment accessibility
- `find_reachable_vertices(graph, source, budget)` - Find treatments within budget constraints
- Works with vertex indices directly - full control over graph structure

### **Approach 2: Domain-Specific Convenience Functions**  
For healthcare professionals, the example provides intuitive wrappers:
- `create_treatment_protocol(treatments, costs, efficacy, transitions)` - Build protocol with treatment names
- `optimize_treatment_sequence(protocol, start_treatment, end_treatment)` - Find optimal pathway using familiar terminology
- `analyze_treatment_accessibility(protocol, treatment_name)` - Treatment-specific metrics

**The example explicitly demonstrates both approaches side-by-side**, including the treatment-specific accessibility helper, so you can choose between generic graph functions and named clinical wrappers.

## 📊 Mathematical Formulation

### Problem Definition

Given a set of medical treatments and their valid transitions, we seek the optimal treatment sequence that minimizes total cost (financial, temporal, risk-adjusted) while maximizing clinical outcomes and quality of life.

### Mathematical Framework

Let us define:
- **$\mathcal{T} = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}$**: Set of treatments or clinical decision points
- **$c: \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}^+$**: Cost function for each treatment (in thousands of dollars)
- **$e: \mathcal{T} \to [0,1]$**: Efficacy function for each treatment
- **$\mathcal{P} \subseteq \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathbb{R}^+$**: Set of valid transitions with costs

### Clinical Graph Construction

We construct a directed graph $G = (V, E, w)$ where:

1. **Vertex set**: $V = \mathcal{T}$ with $|V| = n$

2. **Edge set**: $E = \{(t_i, t_j) : (t_i, t_j, \cdot) \in \mathcal{P}\}$
   
   Edges encode clinical constraints and feasible treatment sequences.

3. **Weight function**:
   $$w(t_i, t_j) = \tau(t_i, t_j) + \frac{c(t_j)}{\max(e(t_j), \varepsilon)}$$
   
   where:
   - $c(t_j)$: Direct cost of treatment $t_j$
   - $\tau(t_i, t_j)$: Transition cost (coordination, waiting time, overhead)
   - $e(t_j)$: Efficacy factor (down-weights less effective treatments)
   - $\varepsilon$: Small numerical safeguard preventing division by zero

### The Optimization Problem

**Primary Objective**: Find the minimum-cost treatment path from initial state $s$ to target outcome $t$:

$$\pi^* = \arg\min_{\pi \in \Pi(s,t)} C(\pi) = \arg\min_{\pi} \sum_{e \in \pi} w(e)$$

**Multi-Objective Formulation**:
$$\begin{align}
\min \quad & \alpha \cdot \text{Cost}(\pi) + \beta \cdot \text{Time}(\pi) + \gamma \cdot \text{Risk}(\pi) \\
\max \quad & \text{Efficacy}(\pi) \cdot \text{QoL}(\pi) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \pi \in \text{ClinicallyValid}(s,t) \\
& \text{RegulatoryCompliant}(\pi) = \text{true}
\end{align}$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting factors balancing different objectives.

### Key Healthcare Metrics

#### 1. Total Treatment Cost
$$\text{Cost}(\pi) = \sum_{t \in \pi} c(t) + \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|-1} \tau(t_i, t_{i+1})$$

#### 2. Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (CER)
$$\text{CER} = \frac{\text{Cost}(\pi)}{\text{QALY}_{\text{gained}}}$$

where QALY = Quality-Adjusted Life Years.

#### 3. Risk-Benefit Score
$$\text{RBS}(t) = \frac{c(t)}{\max(e(t), \epsilon)}$$

Lower scores indicate better risk-benefit profiles.

#### 4. Pathway Quality Score
$$Q(\pi) = \frac{\text{OutcomeValue}(\pi)}{\text{Cost}(\pi)} \times 100$$

### The DMY Algorithm Application

The DMY algorithm transforms clinical pathway optimization into an efficient graph traversal problem.

#### Algorithm Adaptation for Healthcare

1. **Graph Initialization**:
   ```julia
   for each transition (t_i, t_j, transition_cost):
       weight = transition_cost + treatment_cost[j] / max(efficacy[j], 10^{-6})
       add_edge(t_i → t_j, weight)
   ```

2. **DMY Shortest Path Computation**:
   $$\text{distances} = \text{DMY-SSSP}(G, \text{initial\_screening})$$
   $$\text{optimal\_cost} = \text{distances}[\text{target\_outcome}]$$

3. **Clinical Validation**:
   Ensure the computed path satisfies:
   - Sequential dependencies (diagnosis before treatment)
   - Contraindications (no conflicting treatments)
   - Resource constraints (availability of specialists, equipment)

### Complexity Analysis

For clinical networks:
- **Vertices**: $O(n)$ where typically $n \in [20, 50]$
- **Edges**: $O(n^2)$ worst case, typically $O(n)$ due to clinical constraints
- **Sparsity**: Very sparse (~10% density)
- **DMY Complexity**: $O(m \log^{2/3} n)$
- **Traditional DP**: $O(n^2)$ to $O(n^3)$

## 🏥 Clinical Interpretation

### Cost Components Decomposition

The total cost function incorporates multiple dimensions:

#### 1. Financial Cost
$$c_{\text{financial}}(t) = c_{\text{direct}} + c_{\text{indirect}} + c_{\text{opportunity}}$$

#### 2. Time Cost
$$c_{\text{time}}(t) = t_{\text{duration}} \times c_{\text{daily}} + t_{\text{waiting}}$$

#### 3. Risk Cost
$$c_{\text{risk}}(t) = P(\text{adverse event}) \times \text{severity} \times c_{\text{management}}$$

### Treatment Efficacy Factors

Efficacy $e(t) \in [0,1]$ combines:
- **Clinical efficacy**: Response rate, survival benefit
- **Patient tolerance**: Completion rate, adherence
- **Long-term outcomes**: Recurrence prevention, functional preservation

### Clinical Constraints

The graph structure encodes medical knowledge:
1. **Sequential dependencies**: Staging must precede treatment selection
2. **Contraindications**: Certain drug combinations prohibited
3. **Resource availability**: Limited OR time, specialist availability
4. **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, preferences

## 📈 Example: Cancer Treatment Pathway Optimization

### Clinical Scenario

Consider a cancer treatment pathway with multiple decision points:

```
Screening → Imaging → Biopsy → Staging → MDT Review
                                              ↓
                                    Surgery / Chemo / Radiation
                                              ↓
                                         Monitoring
                                              ↓
                                    Remission / Recurrence
```

### Treatment Costs and Efficacy

| Treatment | Cost ($k) | Efficacy | Risk-Benefit Ratio |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Screening | 0.5 | 1.00 | 0.50 |
| Imaging | 2.0 | 0.95 | 2.11 |
| Biopsy | 1.5 | 0.98 | 1.53 |
| Surgery (Minor) | 15.0 | 0.85 | 17.65 |
| Surgery (Major) | 35.0 | 0.90 | 38.89 |
| Chemotherapy | 20.0 | 0.75 | 26.67 |
| Radiation | 30.0 | 0.85 | 35.29 |
| Immunotherapy | 40.0 | 0.70 | 57.14 |

### DMY Algorithm Execution

Starting from Initial Screening with $\text{dist}[\text{Screening}] = 0$:

$$\begin{align}
\text{dist}[\text{Imaging}] &= 0.5 + 0.2 + \frac{2.0}{0.95} = 2.81 \\
\text{dist}[\text{Biopsy}] &= 2.81 + 0.5 + \frac{1.5}{0.98} = 4.84 \\
\text{dist}[\text{Staging}] &= 4.84 + 0.3 + \frac{1.0}{0.90} = 6.25 \\
\text{dist}[\text{MDT Review}] &= 6.25 + 0.2 + \frac{0.8}{0.85} = 7.39
\end{align}$$

The algorithm then evaluates treatment options, finding the optimal path based on patient-specific factors.

### Clinical Decision Support Output

**Optimal Pathway** (Standard Risk Patient):
1. Screening → Imaging → Biopsy → Staging
2. MDT Review → Surgery Consultation
3. Surgery (Minor) → Adjuvant Chemotherapy
4. Follow-up Monitoring → Remission

**Total Cost**: $48.3k  
**Expected QALYs Gained**: 8.5  
**Cost per QALY**: $5,682 (well below $50,000 threshold)
