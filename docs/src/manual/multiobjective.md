# Multi-Objective Optimization

OptimShortestPaths provides comprehensive support for multi-objective optimization through Pareto front computation.

## Overview

When you have multiple conflicting objectives (e.g., minimize cost AND minimize time), there's no single "best" solution. Instead, you need to find the **Pareto front** - the set of solutions where improving one objective requires sacrificing another.

## Computing the Pareto Front

### Basic Usage

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

# Create multi-objective graph
edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),  # [cost, time] for edge 1->2
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 3, [2.0, 1.0], 2)   # [cost, time] for edge 2->3
]

# Build adjacency list
adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:3]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(
    3,                      # n_vertices
    edges,                  # edges with weights
    2,                      # n_objectives
    adjacency,              # adjacency list
    ["Cost", "Time"]        # objective names
)

source = 1
target = 3

# Compute Pareto front
pareto_solutions = compute_pareto_front(graph, source, target; max_solutions=1000)

# Each solution has:
for sol in pareto_solutions
    println("Objectives: ", sol.objectives)  # [total_cost, total_time]
    println("Path: ", sol.path)              # Vertex sequence
end
```

All upcoming examples repeat this lightweight setup so each block can be copied into a fresh Julia REPL and run on its own. If you are working through the page sequentially, feel free to skip the duplicated `using` and graph-construction code and reuse the `graph`, `source`, and `target` variables already in scope.

### Bounded Pareto Computation

To prevent exponential growth of the Pareto set:

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 3, [2.0, 1.0], 2)
]

adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:3]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(3, edges, 2, adjacency, ["Cost", "Time"])
source = 1
target = 3

pareto_solutions = compute_pareto_front(
    graph, source, target;
    max_solutions=1000  # Stop after 1000 solutions
)
```

## Scalarization Methods

Each helper in this section returns a `ParetoSolution`, giving you direct access to the objectives vector and reconstructed path.

### Weighted Sum Approach

Convert multiple objectives into a single weighted sum:

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 3, [2.0, 1.0], 2)
]

adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:3]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(3, edges, 2, adjacency, ["Cost", "Time"])
source = 1
target = 3

weights = [0.7, 0.3]  # 70% cost, 30% time
solution = weighted_sum_approach(graph, source, target, weights)
println("Objectives: ", solution.objectives)
println("Path: ", solution.path)
```

!!! warning "Minimization Only"
    `weighted_sum_approach` currently requires all objectives to be minimization (`:min`). Transform maximization objectives first.

### Epsilon-Constraint Method

Optimize one objective while constraining others:

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 3, [2.0, 1.0], 2)
]

adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:3]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(3, edges, 2, adjacency, ["Cost", "Time"])
source = 1
target = 3

# Minimize cost subject to: time ≤ 10.0
solution = epsilon_constraint_approach(
    graph, source, target,
    1,              # Objective index to minimize (cost)
    [Inf, 10.0]     # Constraints on objectives [cost, time]
)
println("Objectives: ", solution.objectives)
println("Path: ", solution.path)
```

### Lexicographic Optimization

Optimize objectives in priority order:

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 3, [2.0, 1.0], 2)
]

adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:3]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(3, edges, 2, adjacency, ["Cost", "Time"])
source = 1
target = 3

priorities = [1, 2]  # First minimize obj 1 (cost), then obj 2 (time)
solution = lexicographic_approach(graph, source, target, priorities)
println("Objectives: ", solution.objectives)
println("Path: ", solution.path)
```

## Decision Support

### Finding the Knee Point

The "knee point" offers the best trade-off between objectives:

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

# Setup from previous examples
edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 3, [2.0, 1.0], 2)
]

adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:3]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(3, edges, 2, adjacency, ["Cost", "Time"])
source = 1
target = 3

pareto_solutions = compute_pareto_front(graph, source, target)

# Find solution with best trade-off
best_solution = get_knee_point(pareto_solutions)

println("Best trade-off: ", best_solution.objectives)
println("Path: ", best_solution.path)
```

The knee point uses a geometric trade-off heuristic. In two objectives, it selects the Pareto solution with the largest perpendicular distance from the chord joining the normalized extreme points. For higher-dimensional fronts, it falls back to the distance from the normalized utopia-nadir diagonal. When objectives mix minimization and maximization senses, pass `objective_sense` so the normalization matches the front correctly.

## Working with Objective Senses

### Minimization and Maximization

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

# Define mixed objectives
edges = [MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [5.0, 8.0], 1)]  # [cost_to_minimize, profit_to_maximize]

# Build adjacency list
adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:2]
push!(adjacency[1], 1)

# Specify senses
graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(
    2,                               # n_vertices
    edges,                           # edges
    2,                               # n_objectives
    adjacency,                       # adjacency list
    ["Cost", "Profit"],              # objective names
    objective_sense = [:min, :max]   # Minimize cost, maximize profit
)

# Pareto front respects both senses
pareto_front = compute_pareto_front(graph, 1, 2)
```

### Converting Maximization to Minimization

For scalarization methods that require `:min`:

```julia
# Original: maximize profit
# Transform: minimize negative profit

original_profit = 100.0
minimization_objective = -original_profit

# Or subtract from baseline
baseline = 1000.0
minimization_objective = baseline - original_profit
```

## Example: Cost-Time Trade-off

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

# Supply chain network: minimize cost AND time
edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [10.0, 1.0], 1),  # Cheap but slow
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 3, [30.0, 0.5], 2),  # Expensive but fast
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 4, [5.0, 2.0], 3),   # Cheap and slow
    MultiObjectiveEdge(3, 4, [15.0, 1.0], 4)   # Moderate
]

# Build adjacency list
adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:4]
for (idx, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], idx)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(
    4,                      # n_vertices
    edges,                  # edges
    2,                      # n_objectives (cost, time)
    adjacency,              # adjacency list
    ["Cost", "Time"]        # objective names
)

# Find all Pareto-optimal paths
pareto_front = compute_pareto_front(graph, 1, 4)

println("Found ", length(pareto_front), " Pareto-optimal solutions:")
for (i, sol) in enumerate(pareto_front)
    println("  $i. Cost: $(sol.objectives[1]), Time: $(sol.objectives[2])")
end

# Select best trade-off
best = get_knee_point(pareto_front)
println("\nBest trade-off: Cost=$(best.objectives[1]), Time=$(best.objectives[2])")
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Pareto set size**: Can grow exponentially; use `max_solutions` to bound it
- **Number of objectives**: 2-3 objectives typical; 4+ can be slow
- **Graph size**: Pareto computation is slower than single-objective
- **Dominated solutions**: Automatically filtered during computation
