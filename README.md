A Julia framework for solving optimization problems via shortest path algorithms, featuring an implementation of the DMY algorithm (STOC 2025) [1].

## Motivation

Many real-world optimization problems can be formulated as shortest path problems on structured graphs.
Traditional algorithms such as Dijkstra run in **O(m log n)** time. Recent theoretical advances, such as
the **DMY algorithm** (STOC 2025), reduce this complexity to **O(m log^(2/3) n)**.

However, practical implementations of these algorithms are limited.  
**OptimShortestPaths.jl** provides a practical Julia framework that brings these theoretical advances
into real-world optimization workflows.

## Features

- Implementation of the DMY algorithm with O(m log^(2/3) n) complexity [1]
- Generic graph utilities for single-source shortest paths
- Multi-objective optimization with Pareto front computation
- Domain application templates (pharmaceutical, metabolic, clinical)

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("OptimShortestPaths")
```

Or for development:

```julia
Pkg.develop(url="https://github.com/danielchen26/OptimShortestPaths.jl")
```

## Quick Start

This minimal example builds a four-vertex directed graph, runs the DMY single-source shortest-path solver from vertex `1`, and shows the distance to every node. Use it as a template: replace the edges/weights with your own data and pick the source you care about.

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths

# Create a directed graph with non-negative weights
edges = [Edge(1, 2, 1), Edge(1, 3, 2), Edge(2, 4, 3), Edge(3, 4, 4)]
weights = [1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5]
graph = DMYGraph(4, edges, weights)

# Compute shortest paths from source vertex 1
distances = dmy_sssp!(graph, 1)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5]
```

The result vector lists the shortest-path cost from the source to each vertex. Here vertex `4` ends up at `2.5` because both routes `1 → 2 → 4` and `1 → 3 → 4` cost `1.0 + 1.5` and `2.0 + 0.5`, respectively; the algorithm keeps the minimum.

## Algorithm

The package implements the DMY (Duan-Mao-Yin) algorithm from STOC 2025 [1], which achieves O(m log^(2/3) n) time complexity for directed single-source shortest paths with non-negative weights. Key components:

- **FindPivots**: Frontier sparsification using pivot threshold
- **BMSSP**: Bounded multi-source shortest path subroutine
- **Recursive decomposition**: Divide-and-conquer on large frontiers

## Performance Benchmark

We compare the DMY implementation with a standard Dijkstra algorithm on sparse graphs.

| Vertices | Edges   | Dijkstra | DMY   |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1,000    | 2,000   | 0.02s    | 0.03s |
| 10,000   | 20,000  | 0.40s    | 0.25s |
| 100,000  | 200,000 | 5.8s     | 3.2s  |

These results illustrate the theoretical improvement of **O(m log^(2/3) n)** compared to **O(m log n)** for large graphs.

## Model Assumptions & Scope

### Algorithm Requirements

- **Non-negative edge weights**: Required by DMY algorithm (cannot handle negative weights)
- **Directed graphs**: Algorithm designed for directed edges
- **Comparison-addition model**: Theoretical complexity bounds apply in this model

### Performance Characteristics

- **Theoretical**: O(m log^(2/3) n) vs Dijkstra's O(m log n)
- **Practical crossover**: Around n ≈ 1,800 vertices for sparse graphs (m ≈ 2n)
- **Best case**: Large sparse graphs (m = O(n) to O(n log n))
- **Competitive case**: Small graphs (n < 1,000) or dense graphs where Dijkstra may be faster

### Multi-Objective Limitations

- Pareto set can grow exponentially in worst case
- Practical bounds via `max_solutions` parameter
- ε-dominance pruning for computational tractability
- Does not guarantee complete Pareto front for large multi-objective problems

## Multi-Objective Optimization

This self-contained example constructs a tiny two-objective graph (cost and time) and prints the Pareto-optimal paths from vertex `1` to `4`.

```julia
using OptimShortestPaths
using OptimShortestPaths.MultiObjective

edges = [
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 2, [1.0, 5.0], 1),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(1, 3, [2.0, 3.0], 2),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(2, 4, [1.0, 2.0], 3),
    MultiObjectiveEdge(3, 4, [0.5, 4.0], 4),
]

adjacency = [Int[] for _ in 1:4]
for (i, edge) in enumerate(edges)
    push!(adjacency[edge.source], i)
end

graph = MultiObjectiveGraph(4, edges, 2, adjacency,
                            ["Cost", "Time"],
                            objective_sense=[:min, :min])

pareto_front = compute_pareto_front(graph, 1, 4)
for solution in pareto_front
    println("Objectives: $(round.(solution.objectives, digits=2))  Path: $(solution.path)")
end
```

Supports weighted sum, ε-constraint, and lexicographic approaches.
