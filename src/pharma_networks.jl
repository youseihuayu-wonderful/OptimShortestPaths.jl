Pharmaceutical network implementations for drug discovery and healthcare applications.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are OPTIONAL CONVENIENCE FUNCTIONS for pharmaceutical domains.

For general use, please use the GENERIC utility functions in utilities.jl:
- `find_shortest_path()` - works for ANY domain, not just drug-target
- `analyze_connectivity()` - works for ANY vertex, not just drugs
- `calculate_distance_ratio()` - works for ANY selectivity/preference calculation
- `find_reachable_vertices()` - works for ANY reachability analysis

The functions in this file are thin convenience wrappers that:
1. Handle name-to-vertex mappings for the pharmaceutical domain
2. Provide domain-specific naming (e.g., "drug", "target", "metabolite")
3. Call the underlying generic functions

ANY domain can create similar convenience wrappers or use the generic functions directly.

Create a drug-target interaction network from drug names, target names, and interaction matrix.
The interaction matrix contains binding affinities or interaction strengths.

# Arguments
- `drugs`: Vector of drug names
- `targets`: Vector of target protein names  
- `interactions`: Matrix where interactions[i,j] is the binding affinity between drug i and target j

# Returns
- DrugTargetNetwork with underlying graph representation

# Network Structure
- Vertices represent both drugs and targets
- Edges represent drug-target interactions
- Edge weights are -log(binding_affinity) to convert to distance metric
