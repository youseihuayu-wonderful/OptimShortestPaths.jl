Recursive layer processing function that implements the core DMY algorithm logic.
Processes vertex subset U with current frontier S and upper bound B.

# Arguments
- `graph`: The graph to process
- `dist`: Distance array (modified in-place)
- `parent`: Parent array for path reconstruction (modified in-place)

- `B`: Upper bound for distance updates

The function implements the recursive layering strategy with:
1. Base case handling for small vertex sets
2. Pivot threshold calculation k = ⌈|U|^(1/3)⌉
3. Frontier size checking and algorithm path selection
4. Pivot selection for frontier sparsification when needed
5. Vertex partitioning and recursive calls
